# BioDaq Food and Water Intake Monitor Time Bins üêÅ

### Overview

__BioDaq Food and Water Intake Monitor__

The [BioDaq Food and Water Intake Monitor](https://researchdiets.com/biodaq) allows food and water levels in each rodent cage to be measured at all times.
This gives greater temporal resolution to food and water intake data, compared to data obatined through manual weighing.

__Purpose__

This code organises the excel output files from the BioDaq Food and Water Intake Monitor into time bins. <br>
It can also group the time binned data by individual stats and animals.
